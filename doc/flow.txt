USERS
=====

1. Make user: just enter data in 'Users' table.

2. Link user to game: Make GameUser record, and link it to User and to GamePlay.
   Initialize the scores based on the Game's PlayOrganization record information.
   Set GameUser.RoundNumber = 1.


PLAY
====

1. User logs in. 

2. If no UserRound record exists for the GameUser.RoundNumber:
   - Make a new UserRound record for the round (day).

3. If a UserRound record exists, take the one with the HIGHEST roundNumber.
   - Find all unpublished orders for the 'left' menu.
   - Find all published orders of all rounds for the 'right' menu; order by round.
   
4. When Publish order is clicked:
   - Make UserOrder record with published equal to 'true'.
   - remove the order from the unpublished orders on the screen
   - add the order to the published orders at the end
 
5. When Accept quote is clicked:
   - Create SelectedCarrier record for the selection.
   
6. When last order has been chosen for the day:
   - Show popup with transportation outcome
   
7. When pressing "OK" on Transportation outcome:
   - Increase the round number
   
8. If round number > highest round number:
   - Do not retrieve new orders for that round.
   - Since the user cannot publish any orders anymore, no new info can be added, but all info can be inspected still.
   
9. Go to 2.

   
Note: published orders without a selected carrier have multiple carriers and 'accept quote' buttons.
      published orders with a selected carrier for the current round have a 'transportation' icon.
      published orders with a selected carrier for an earlier round have a stars rating.
